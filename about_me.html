My approach draws from a variety of theories and therapies to best fit your needs, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. We'll focus on the thoughts and emotions that arise when you face troubling situations.</p><h2>My Focus</h2><p>I support adults navigating a range of life challenges, from anxiety and depression to the difficulties of loss and uncertainty during significant transitions. Together, we can work towards empowering you to reclaim control and find clarity in your life.</p><h2>My Communication Style</h2><p>I am an energetic and engaged therapist who believes the therapeutic process should include sufficient dialogue to allow the client to feel comfortable in a conversational setting that easily facilitates reflection and focus on their therapy goals. I strive to create an open and inviting atmosphere where clients can feel comfortable sharing their deepest feelings and innermost thoughts without fear of judgment. Therapy is a process that can be challenging and, at times, uncomfortable, but the reward is worth the effort.</p><h2>My Journey to Mental Healthcare</h2><p>My journey into the field of social work began in 2014 when I embarked on a Master's Degree, fueled by a deep passion for making a meaningful difference in the lives of others. I found great fulfillment in helping individuals navigate their challenges by equipping them with innovative tools and effective coping strategies.</p><p>Throughout my academic journey, I gained invaluable experience through internships, working with adults with intellectual disabilities and supporting teenagers in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. This hands-on exposure paved the way for my role as a research assistant at the University of Illinois Chicago, where I investigated the Chicago Police Crisis Intervention Teams and examined their critical interactions with community members facing mental health crises.</p><p>My career with the Department of Veterans Affairs followed, where I took on various roles dedicated to serving homeless veterans and engaging in essential community outreach. Eventually, I transitioned to a vital position in Community-Based Suicide Prevention, where I could make an immediate impact on those in need.</p><p>In 2018, I launched my own part-time private practice, which I passionately maintained until 2022. That year, I recognized the importance of expanding my expertise and decided to pursue a Master's in Business Administration from UIC. Currently, I serve full-time in a role akin to Chief of Staff at the Veterans Affairs Department.</p><h2>My Goals for You</h2><p>I view therapy as a dynamic partnership. Together, we will identify and create goals that truly resonate with you—whether that's enhancing your relationships, boosting your self-esteem, or pursuing other important personal aspirations. As you embark on this journey, your goals may shift as you gain valuable insights. That's perfectly okay; we can adapt our approach at any time to ensure it stays relevant and meaningful for you. I am committed to equipping you with the support and tools necessary to help you move confidently toward your desired future, even when faced with challenges.</p><h2>My First Session with You</h2><p>In our first session, we will connect and discuss your background and reasons for seeking therapy. Remember, this is a process, and together, we’ll build a strong foundation over time. It's normal to feel anxious about your first appointment, but I'll be here to guide you every step of the way.</p><h2>Specialties</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6"><li>Individual Therapy</li><li>Adults</li></ul><h2>Treatment Approaches</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 columns-2 gap-8"><li>Acceptance and Commitment (ACT)</li><li>Cognitive Behavioral (CBT)</li><li>Cognitive Processing (CPT)</li><li>Compassion Focused</li><li>Dialectical (DBT)</li><li>Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)</li><li>Internal Family Systems (IFS)</li><li>Interpersonal</li><li>Motivational Interviewing</li><li>Narrative</li><li>Person-Centered</li><li>Positive Psychology</li><li>Psychoanalytic</li><li>Psychodynamic</li><li>Solution Focused</li><li>Solution Focused Brief (SFBT)</li><li>Strength-Based</li></ul><h2>Focus Areas</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 columns-2 gap-8"><li>ADHD</li><li>Anger Management</li><li>Anxiety</li><li>Behavioral Issues</li><li>Career Counseling</li><li>Coping Skills</li><li>Cultural Stress</li><li>Depression</li><li>Divorce</li><li>Gender Identity</li><li>Grief</li><li>Infidelity</li><li>Life Transitions</li><li>Men's Issues</li><li>Mood Disorders</li><li>Panic Attacks</li><li>School Issues</li><li>Self Esteem</li><li>Spirituality</li><li>Stress</li></ul></section></div></div></div><hr class="h-px bg-dark-blue border-0"><footer class="footer sm:footer-horizontal footer-end p-4 justify-center bg-light-blue"><aside><p>Copyright © 2025 - All right reserved</p></aside></footer></body></html>
